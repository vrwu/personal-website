                <div id="problem-statement">With COVID-19 and the transition to online education, students have found it
                    harder to pay attention to lectures and homework assignments, resulting in increased procrastination
                    and decreased productivity.

                <div id="section-title">Background</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">With the COVID-19 pandemic, students have made the hard transition from in
                    person
                    to online classes, leading to an decreased rate of motivation. Students who often went to cafes to
                    study
                    could no longer due to lockdown restrictions, resulting
                    in this need for different ways to combat this unmotivated mindset. We found that with reliance on
                    Pomodoro
                    techniques where there are allocated work and break times, students could set their schedule back on
                    track.<br><br>
                    Prior to the pandemic, my friends and I often did our homework at UCSD's Canyon Vista (dining hall).
                    Given the nature of a cafe, we were able to focus and get a lot of work done. However, with COVID-19
                    and
                    lockdown restrictions, we were no longer able to study and do our work in public cafes. We were
                    introduced to
                    the Pomodoro timer but found that it was just as easy to “pause” the timer and go back to taking
                    breaks.
                    We figured that students need something that would keep them on schedule while having allocated
                    break times

                <div id="section-title">User Research/Needfinding</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">When asking our peers, we found that students often side tracked from their
                    current
                    assignment, distracted by other tabs running or by their phone. They told us that the environment at
                    home was too
                    comfortable and hard to concentrate. This led us to investigate what has currently been done to
                    alleviate this.<br><br><br>

                    to find productivity
                    for some, however issues arrise when a student decides to take more break than needed. We found that
                    students then needed
                    a variant of a schedule integrated with the timer to effectively keep them on track.

                <div id="section-paragraph">For our technologies, we used React Native, Expo and Redux.<br><br>
                    I focused more on the front end, leveraging React Native and React Native Paper library to code
                    various screens of our UI.
                    I further tested our functionality through syncing with Expo and Node.js.
                    In the back end, I worked on creating the Pomodoro timer using React Native.

                <div id="section-title">Challenges we faced</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">Given the remote setting of this hackathon, we found it rather difficult to
                    resolve any merge conflicts and debug together. However, we were able to resolve this through being
                    verbal in our call and communicate every step we took to produce certain errors. Aside from
                    communication issues, we were also challenged by the frameworks. For all of us, it was our first
                    time using React Native and this was a great learning experience! We had two first time hackers who
                    were able to adapt to the hackathon environment.

                <div id="section-title">Reflection</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">Being that this project was for a hackathon, I found myself pulling my first
                    all nighter to
                    work with my group members and learned to build an MVP given a 1.5 days. This was my first time
                    working
                    on front end with React Native and I learned how to leverage its libraries to create cleaner looks
                    efficiently. I also found myself delving deeper into the idea of the Pomodoro technique itself and
                    became
                    more knowledgable on study habit techniques and the psychology behind it. Possible improvements this
                    project
                    could have expanded on given more time include more extensive user testing to find bugs in our app
                    and a cleaner
                    organization to our view (so it's not just a long scroll of tasks).
