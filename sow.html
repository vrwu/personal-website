                <div id="problem-statement">Whether it be taking a walk, jogging, or going out to buy groceries,
                    women often find themselves in situations where they have to be extra cautious of their
                    surroundings.
                </div>

                <div id="section-title">Background</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">With the rise of sex trafficking and and kidnappings around the world, women
                    have resorted
                    to purchasing self protection items such as pepper spray, tasers, and alarms as means to keep
                    themselves safe
                    in fear of being victims to these horrendous acts. Although other apps to fight this include
                    features
                    like emergency contacts, police calls, there’s no one app that includes everything that a woman
                    needs to stay safe,
                    including awareness spreading and a section for tips. <br><br>
                    While walking my dog in broad daylight, I find myself extra cautious with my surroundings, looking
                    behind me
                    every now and then to make sure no one’s following me. I even get startled by a car pulling over
                    near me. Although I have pepper
                    spray, I find the need for more items to keep myself safe. On social media, several other women have
                    voiced
                    their experiences surrounding this topic, thus leading me to want something that encompassed
                    everything that
                    pertained to women safety and that could connect us and our contacts.

                <div id="section-paragraph">Inspired by recent events and increased media presence on women safety, this
                    iOS app aims to
                    promote the safety of women through awareness and action. <br><br>
                    <b>Features:</b> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><i><b>Emergency SOS Messaging and Location Tracking to Emergency Contacts</b></i> - with the
                            tap of a button,

                        <li><i><b>Live Map of Incidents</b></i> - integrated maps with pinpoint locations and incident

                <div id="section-paragraph">These statistics derive from the 2019 data report for the U.S National Human
                    Trafficking Hotline. As we understand that this
                    does not encompass the entirety of trafficking cases, the large numbers allowed us to judge that
                    this was an issue that needed to be addressed.<br><br><br>

                <div id="section-paragraph"> <br> Further, through investigating local social media pages like <a
                        href="https://www.instagram.com/sd_awareness/" target="_blank"><b>@sdawareness</b></a> on
                    Instgram,
                    we found that there was a lot of attention on the topic but stayed central to just self reflected
                    stories. This made us want to build an app that encompassed various topics
                    pertaining to spreading awareness, tips, and safety.

                <div id="section-paragraph"> <br> We also investigated other apps related to safety and found

                        target="_blank"><b>Indian SOS Women Safety</b></a>

                    both of which had similar features. We used these two apps to draw inspiration from
                    but also refine and bring uniqueness to our app.

                <div id="section-title">UI Design</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">We used Figma to design our app's UI. Starting with the Mockup, we gauged
                    what elements we wanted on our screens and refined that to our Final.</div>

                <div id="section-title">Programming</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">For our front end, we used React Native and Google Places and Maps API. We
                    connected the front and back end through Axios.<br><br>
                    I focused more on the back end, leveraging Python Flask as our back end server and Google Firebase
                    as our database and authentication. I further implemented the Emergency
                    SOS contact messaging through Twilio API and built Docker containers to allow front end to run the
                    back end.

                <div id="section-title">Reflection</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">Throughout this entire process, I learned to build an MVP given a 10 week
                    timeline. It was also my first time engaging in a project,
                    so I learned many new technologies such as Flask, Firebase, and REST APIs. Since this was conducted
                    entirely online due to COVID-19, I found it challenging to
                    communicate with my teammates, however we were able to tackle this through weekly standups and work
                    sessions. Possible improvements this project could have
                    expanded on given more time include more extensive user testing to find bugs in our app.
