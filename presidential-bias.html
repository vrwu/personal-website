                <div id="problem-statement">Can we create a classification model to predict the 2020 presidential bias of politically-focused TikTok videos?
                </div>

                <div id="section-title">Overview</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">TikTok, a social media platform that recently rose to fame around the world, has set the
                    stage for users to express their political ideologies in short videos with the recent 2020 Presidential Election. We
                    decided to gather data leveraging various political hashtags to see if we can predict the presidential bias of a
                    politically-focused TikTok video. 
                    <br><br>
                    Through the predictive model, we generated with the data we scraped from the most
                    popular TikTok videos, we were able to accurately predict the bias of any given TikTok video and also discovered
                    that TikTok has a predominantly left demographic. The findings of our project has allowed us to better understand
                    the role of machine learning in predictive analysis and our data can also be used to better understand the biases
                    that exist in social media content.</div>

                <div id="section-title">Background and Prior Work</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">The social media platform known as TIkTok is an app created by ByteDance Ltd. to cultivate
                    creativity among its users through short videos (known as TikToks) grouped by hashtags and genre. Since its
                    conception in September 2016, TikTok has risen in popularity around the world, especially among the younger
                    demographic aged 16-24 [1]. With the recent 2020 election, social media platforms witnessed a surge in
                    politically-related content. This year's election was the first election for TikTok since its rise to popularity and
                    so naturally, political TikTok videos consisting of activism and awareness began surfacing among its users [2]. This
                    makes sense as it is well known that social media has an influence on human beliefs and behaviors.<br><br>
                
                    Through personal experience using the TikTok platform, we have seen how the app's system heavily relies on the use
                    of hashtags. With the influx of political TikTok videos, we observed the specific hashtags that were used by
                    creators posting these videos. Among these hashtags are election candidate names, party affiliation, and political
                    ideology. It was interesting to see how we could anticipate the content of the video based on the hashtags being
                    used. This was more difficult, however, when hashtags reflecting multiple parties were used. This led us to ask
                    whether or not there was a way to accurately predict the content of TikTok videos based on their hashtags and video
                    descriptions. With the presidential election overlapping a large section of the Fall 2020 quarter, we sought to
                    answer this question more directly, as it pertained to that election. The more specific question we sought to answer
                    was if the hashtag frequency, likes, view count, and other TikTok metrics could be used to predict the presidential
                    bias of a TikTok during the election.<br><br>
                
                    One past study we found on TikTok in the context of the election focused on TikTok's algorithm for suggesting
                    content to its users. Jack Bandy, a PhD student studying AI, ethics, and media, discovered that unlike other
                    platforms, which rely on "friends" and "followers" to suggest relevant content, TikTok's suggestion algorithm
                    focuses primarily on popular videos chosen by all of its users [3]. With this in mind, we know that the popular
                    political videos we are analyzing truly are popular among the primary user demographic of the platform.
                
                    TikTok has no official API available for use to use, so to retrieve the necessary data to answer our research
                    question, we use an Unofficial TikTok API developed by David Teather, a Computer Science student from Wisconsin [4].
                    With this, we are able to find the most popular TikTok videos related to the 2020 election and analyze their
                    hashtags and descriptions. <br><br>

                <div id="section-title">Hypothesis</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">We hypothesize that data fields of a TikTok, such as hashtags, descriptions, likes, and play
                    counts will greatly contribute to the sentiment of a TiKTok, allowing us to use those data fields in order to
                    generate a predictive model that uses data on hashtags in order to find the presidential bias of a given TikTok. We
                    believe that with this data, we will be able to leverage Machine Learning models such as the <b>Gaussian Naive Bayes
                    model</b> in order to predict whether or not the sentiment of the TikTok is Trump- or Biden-leaning relative to the 2020
                    Presidential Election. Note that the predictive model training is based on data surrounding presidential candidates
                    as the metric for left and right leaning TikToks, so the data is more specific to the presidential election.
                
                    A potential source of inaccuracy could come from the fact that the sentiment of a hashtag may not represent the
                    sentiment of the TikTok, as hashtags relate more directly to the topic rather than the sentiment on that topic.

                <div id="section-paragraph">
                    For our datasets, we leveraged David Teather's Unofficial TikTok API, specifically the functionality to grab TikToks

                    observations x, the API will pull the top x amount of TikToks of a hashtag and automatically sort them by like count in
                    descending order. <br><br>

                    Instagram,
                    we found that there was a lot of attention on the topic but stayed central to just self reflected
                    stories. This made us want to build an app that encompassed various topics
                    pertaining to spreading awareness, tips, and safety.

                    both of which had similar features. We used these two apps to draw inspiration from
                    but also refine and bring uniqueness to our app. We liked the ideas of the SOS Emergency Alert, 
                    Location Sharing, and the Tips/Videos. We found that these were core features that needed to be
                    implemented together in one application.

                    I focused more on the back end, leveraging <b>Python Flask</b> as our back end server and <b>Google Firebase</b>
                    as our database and authentication. I further implemented the Emergency
                    SOS contact messaging through <b>Twilio API</b> and built <b>Docker</b> containers to allow front end to run the
                    back end. To test my back end functionalities, I utilized <b>Postman</b> to parse my <b>JSON</b> strings, 
                    <b>HTML</b>, <b>Javascript</b> and <b>Google Places and Maps API</b> to test the basic layout.

                <div id="section-title">Challenges we faced</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">Originally, we intended to use <b>Google Maps and Places API</b> in the back end
                    but we found many issues when connecting the front and back end, so we had to move it to be used
                    in the front end. Further, when we designed the app to be iOS, I was unable to test on my end
                    due to having a Windows, so I ended up testing the back end functionality without having access to 
                    the front end and made basic <b>HTML</b> pages to test. 
                </div>

                <div id="section-title">Reflection</div>
                <div id="section-paragraph">Throughout this entire process, I learned to build an MVP given a 10 week
                    timeline. It was also my first time engaging in a project,
                    so I learned many new technologies such as <b>Flask, Firebase, and REST APIs</b>. Since this was conducted
                    entirely online due to COVID-19, I found it challenging to
                    communicate with my teammates, however we were able to tackle this through weekly standups and work
                    sessions. Possible improvements this project could have
                    expanded on given more time include more extensive user testing to find bugs in our app.
